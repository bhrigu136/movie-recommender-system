# movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity

This project is an AI-based **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies similar to a selected movie. It uses a **content-based filtering approach** with similarity scores and integrates with **TMDB API** to fetch movie posters, providing an interactive user interface built with Streamlit.

## Problem Statement

### Problem Statement ID: MRS-101
**Title**: Build a Movie Recommendation System with an interactive UI.

**Description**:  
The aim of this project is to recommend movies similar to a given movie. Users can select a movie from a dropdown list, and the system will suggest the top 5 most similar movies along with their posters. The similarity is computed based on feature vectors of movies.

## Model Information

- **Model Type**: Content-Based Filtering (Cosine Similarity / feature vectors)
- **Features Considered**:
  - Movie title
  - Movie overview / metadata (processed as vectors)
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity (precomputed and stored in `similarity.pkl`)

---

## Model Inputs

The following parameter is required for prediction:

- **Movie Title**: Select a movie from the dropdown list.  
Once selected, the system will generate the top 5 most similar movies.

## Streamlit UI

- **Movie Selection**: Users can choose a movie from a dropdown list.  
- **Recommendations**: Displays top 5 recommended movies with posters fetched from **TMDB API**.  
- **Interactive Layout**: Recommendations are shown in 5 columns for better visualization.
